      Where do I park?
    </dt>
    <dd class="faq__answer">
      <p>If you have young children, the best place to park is in the back of the church.  Come in the glass doors and follow the hallway to our AVENUE Kids check-in counter.  If you do not have children, or if you need special assistance you can park in our front parking lot.</p>

      Do I have to dress up to attend?
    </dt>
    <dd class="faq__answer">
      <p>Though many people dress up somewhat to attend church, we definitely don’t have a dress code. The majority of men do not wear a tie (just in case you were wondering). We want you to come and worship with us, so please don’t let this hold you back from coming.</p>

      Do you use a particular Bible translation?
    </dt>
    <dd class="faq__answer">
      <p>Our pastors preach using the New American Standard Bible (1995 update) because it is easy to understand and is a very accurate translation for Bible study. Many of our church family bring other versions to church because they find that it helps them understand the Bible even better when they can compare different translations together.</p>

      <p>There is a wide variety of ministries in which you can serve, spanning from preschool and children’s ministry to music and prayer ministries.
